        <h1>Hello!</h1>
        <p>1. My name is Peyton Moore and I'm a junior majoring in Design with a minor in Business of the Arts!</p>

        <p>2. I have a background in Fashion and Graphic design, and have been exploring both art practices in my time at Sam Fox. I am in Interaction Foundations because I believe learning code and UI/UX Design is essential in any design profession.</p>

        <p>3. I took an intro coding class in high school but am looking forward to refreshing my memory and learning much more!</p>

        <p>4. I hope to learn basic code helpful for website design!</p>

        <p>5. I expect designing for screen to be a bit tedious and technical. Its definitely not something that comes easy to me but I'm excited to learn more.</p>

        <p>6. The below link provides a website that exemplifies effective design. It is easy to scroll through this artists work at a glance. They've provided further information about each work found embedded into each photo.  </p>

        <p>7. The below link provides a website that exemplifies effective communication. Immediately, the aesthetic and photos tell us that Torus is a Yoga studio. There are class descriptions, spots to book studio spaces, and event information. </p>

        <p>8. The below link provides a website that works well. The website is easy to navigate with a minimanl aesthetic, modern design, and smooth transitions. The design of this website mimics the aesthetics of Szeki's clothes.  </p>
