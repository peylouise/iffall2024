            <p>When the weather's fine, when it's sunny outside</p>
            <p>Think about the time I kicked a boy 'til he cried</p>
            <p>Oh, I could've been wrong, but I don't think I was</p>
            <p>He's such a child</p>
            <p>When I am alone, I remember so well</p>
            <p>How merrily I tripped a boy so he fell</p>
            <p>Oh I could've been wrong, but I don't think I was</p>
            <p>He's totally wild</p>
            <p>And I've been wondering lately just who's gonna save me</p>
            <p>Now I have a cold, and no story to tell</p>
            <p>I'd marry you but I'm so unwell</p>
            <p>And I could've been wrong</p>
            <p>Well I don't think I was</p>
            <p>He's totally wild</p>
            <p>And I've been wondering lately</p>
            <p>Just who's gonna save me</p>
            <p>Yes you should've been wise</p>
            <p>Oh hysterical child</p>
            <p>Where'd you learn to do that</p>
